I won a sweet foil [Tarmogoyf](card:Tarmogoyf) at a 24-players Modern event.
My [list](http://magicmonk.ch/WebRoot/Store/Shops/170349/MediaGallery/Decklisten/Modern_07052016/Modern_07052016_Riccardo_Cecolin.pdf)
differed from the previous ones I played mostly because of the two [Etched Champions](card:Etched Champion)
that made it back into the main deck as well as the 2nd [Galvanic Blast](card:Galvanic Blast) added for extra explosiveness.
Results and decklists are up on the store [website](http://magicmonk.ch/epages/170349.sf/de_CH/?ObjectPath=/Shops/170349/Categories/Events/Constructed_Modern/Standings/Modern_07052016).
