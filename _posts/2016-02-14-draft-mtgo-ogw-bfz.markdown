title: Draft MTGO 2xOGW 1xBFZ

I recently created an account on Magic Online to get my weekly magic fix when I can't attend the local FNM event. The account comes with a bunch of credits that grant you access to new-player drafts, so I joined a _2 x Oath of the Gatewatch - 1 x Battle for Zendikar_ queue. Those are 4 players queues so the strategical depth of the draft is not exactly the best you could get but it's still a good way to learn the format.

In the first pack I open [Munda's Vanguard](card:Munda's Vanguard) which was probably one of the few cards that would have made me happily lock-in the allies strategy in the first picks. The resulting deck that made me 2-0 the queue was a __Wu__ allies/flyers with 3x[Ondu War Cleric](card:Ondu War Cleric) and [Roiling Waters](card:Roiling Waters) as a finisher.
