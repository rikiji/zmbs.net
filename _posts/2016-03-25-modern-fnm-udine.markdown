The FNM was very small, just 8 players. The LGS owner decided for 3 rounds + Top 4 to let people play a bit more.

## Round 1 &bull; Jund 2-0

I (slowly) beat him with a [Vault Skirge](card:Vault Skirge) and whatever was not immediately taken down by his removal spells. He went down to 2, then it became a race against [Kalitas](card:Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet]’s lifelink which was ended in my favor by a [Cranial Plating].
In Game 2 I gloriously countered a 4th turn [Damnation](card:Damnation) with my single copy of [Stubborn Denial](card:Stubborn Denial) and then won very quickly.

> 1-0

## Round 2 &bull; UB Processor Eldrazi 2-0

I mulliganed to 6, I remember having a slow but decent hand. My opponent apparently kept something like 6 lands because he played literally no threats, and my creatures in play were not impressed by his copies of [Thoughtseize](card:Thoughtseize] and [Inquisition of Kozilek](card:Inquisition of Kozilek).
Game 2 he found no answers to an early [Master of Etherium](card:Master of Etherium), which he chump blocked until death.

> 2-0

## Round 3 &bull; ID 0-0 

Intentional draw to get the best seed in top 4.

> 2-0-1

## Semifinal &bull; Infect 2-0

My opponent mulliganed aggressively to find a hand faster than mine, but was punished by that because he went down to 4 cards and lost. Game 2 was a race between his unblockable blue guy and my fliers, at some point he had a chance to win by topdecking another pump spell, it did not happen and was beaten down by several Ornithopters.

> 3-0-1

## Final & GB Processor Eldrazi 2-0

In Game 1 my robot army was decimated by multiple [Dismember](card:Dismember)s but my opponent was forced to pay life to cast them, putting him in a spot vulnerable to burst damage that I sneaked in with a Cranial Plating. In game 2 I had a slow starting 7, sent it back only to get 6 cards with no lands. Sent them back again to draw: Mox Opal, Memnite, Darksteel Citadel, Steel Overseer, Master of Etherium. I had two draws to find a land, I drew a [Glimmervoid](card:Glimmervoid) on the first turn and played all my stuff. On the second turn I activated the Overseer to put [Master of Etherium](card:Master of Etherium) out of [Dismember](card:Dismember) range, which in a couple of turns won me the tournament.

 > 4-0-1

I never went below 14 life in the whole tournament, which does not mean anything but still is a pretty cool stat.
