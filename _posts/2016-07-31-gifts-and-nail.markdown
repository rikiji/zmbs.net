title: "Gifts & Nail" Modern Primer
published: true
---

I am proud to present my Modern brew, a deck that uses the mana engine of the old extended [Heartbeat Desire](http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=9218&d=252854&f=EX) deck to somewhat reliably cast a turn four [Tooth and Nail(card:Tooth and Nail). 

```
Main
====
4 Heartbeat of Spring
4 Early Harvest
4 Tooth and Nail
4 Search for Tomorrow
4 Sakura-Tribe Elder
2 Rampant Growth
4 Gifts Ungiven
3 Peer Through Depths
2 Anticipate
1 Revive
1 Noxious Revival
1 Mystic Retrieval
1 Emrakul, the Aeons Torn
1 Xenagos, God of Revels
4 Misty Rainforest
16 Forest
1 Mountain
3 Island

Sideboard (stub)
====
4 Pyroclasm
2 Gutshot
2 Ancient Grudge
2 Dispel
1 Echoing Truth
1 Into the Roil
1 Past in Flames
1 Peer Through Depths
1 Emrakul, The Promised End
```

The game plan consists in ramping turns 1-3 while digging for the missing pieces of the combo. Ideally a turn 4 [Gifts](card:Gifts Ungiven) allows to setup a turn 4 Tooth and Nail. The creature pack used to win the game consist in [Emrakul](card:Emrakul, the Aeons Torn) and [Xenagos](card:Xenagos, God of Revels), that should be a very hard combination to disrupt, being one not targetable by spells and the other one an indestructible enchantment.
A hasted flying 30/30 with annihilator 6 usually guarantees and immediate win. Additonally Modern meta is not exactly counter heavy now, and there are several cards included that let you cast a Tooth and Nail card more than once grabbing it back from the graveyard.

Any of the following combinations allows you to cast Tooth and Nail:

A. 5 lands in play, Tooth and Nail, Early Harvest, Heartbeat of Spring in hand.
B. 5 lands in play, Tooth and Nail, Early Harvest, Early Harvest in hand.
C. 6 lands in play, Tooth and Nail, Early Harvest in hand.

Possible sequences to get to one of them on the 4th turn:

```
T1 Search for Tomorrow
T2 card selection to find Gifts 
T3 Gifts
T4 A or B
```

```
T2 Sakura/Rampant Growth
T3 Gifts/card selection
T4 A or B
```

```
T2 Sakura/Rampant Growth
T3 Sakura/Rampant Growth
T4 C
```

The deck can win on the third turn with an optimal combination of cards:

```
T1 Search for Tomorrow
T2 Sakura/Rampant Growth
T3 combination A from above
```

Results until now: 

## MTGO Modern League
Bogles: 2-1
Jeskai Nahiri: 2-0
Jeskai Nahiri: 2-1
Burn: 1-2
Suicide Zoo: 2-0

> 4-1

## FNM Modern
UB Aggro/Mill: 0-2 (seriously...)
Kiki Chord: 1-2
Kiki-Chord: 2-0

The deck has no sideboard, thatâ€™s something that can have a large positive impact as I usually always won game 1 and struggled a bit more in the second/third. Also it is not yet clear whether to play 8 or 10 ramping spells.
