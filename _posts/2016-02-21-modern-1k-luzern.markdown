## Round 1 GR Eldrazi &bull; 2-0

I played versus a good local player, I remembered seeing him on a Twitch stream of a Modern tournament in Milan on the previous weekend playing RG Eldrazi so I mulliganed for an aggressive hand. He was indeed playing that and I closed the first game simply winning the damage race. 
Game 2 he did not see any sideboard card but he had a bursty hand which allowed him to resolve a [Reality Smasher](card:Reality Smasher) and then a [World Breaker](card:World Breaker) on early turns. I won the game though because of having more flyers he could not block. I remember that on the last turn I could have lost only to double [Gutshot](card:Gutshot) or a single one if I stacked triggers incorrectly, so I played around that too.

> 1-0

## Round 2 Affinity &bull; 0-2

I lost the first game because I did not remember that the creatures spawned by [Hangarback Walker](card:Hangarback Walker) have flying, and attacked with a few flyers for what I thought was lethal into a fat Walker and then lost. Game 2 was lost once he resolved a [Ghirapur AEther Grid](card:Ghirapur AEther Grid) and got a 3-4 card advantage out of it.

> 1-1

## Round 3 Jund &bull; 1-2

I won the first game with a standard hand thanks to raw speed. On the second game I had a decent hand but without much resilience, it was a very grindy game where I brought him down to 3, with a [Dark Confidant](card:Dark Confidant) in play, faced a [Shatterstorm](card:Shattershort) after which the Dark Confidant drew him 2-3 lands in a row. He ended up [terminating](card:Terminate) it to survive and then killing me. On the third game I mulliganed down to 5, brought him very low on life nevertheless but then once the new [vampire with lifelink](card:Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet) hit the table I had no way to keep up with it. The guy ended up winning the tournament.

> 1-2

## Round 4 Affinity &bull; 0-2

Another mirror match, he had busted hands on both games while I was simply slower. I probably should have mulliganed harder in retrospect, but he opened with two [moxes](card:Mox Opal) in game 1 and he had an aether grid before I did in game 2, so I could not have done much anyway. This game led me to increase the number of aether grids in the sideboard to 2 for the next tournament. After the game he showed me what he sided in which made absolutely no sense to me because he diluted his deck too much (two thoughtseize, a stubborn denial and 4-5 more colored cards). After looking at his sideboard strategy I was a bit disappointed I lost this match.

> 1-3

## Round 4 UWR Geist &bull; 2-1

I played versus my teammate, we played so many test games against each other that I do not remember what happened in this series except that game 3 was - extremely - grindy and I snatched victory by poison damage because I drew 3 copies of [Inkmoth Nexus](card:Inkmoth Nexus)

> 2-3

## Conclusions

What I have learned:

- Read every card, twice.
- With the new mulligan rules the first one is almost for free, take it whenever you don't feel having an explosive hand.
- I have to review how many sideboard slots I dedicate to the mirror match as well as what to board out because losing mirrors sucks.

In general unsatisfying results but a very good training for GP Bologna, which will take place in two weeks.
