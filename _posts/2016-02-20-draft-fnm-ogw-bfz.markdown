The pack I opened was super weak but my second and third picks have been [Malakir Soothsayer](card:Malakir Soothsayer) and [Drana's Chosen](card:Drana's Chosen), so I tried to build around them but I did not see another decent black card for ages. I ended up going __Wrb__ picking several white allies with an extra red splash for even more allies including a [Resolute Blademaster](card:Resolute Blademaster), which did a lot of work. I was damn scared of mulliganing ok-ish but slow hands because I was playing three colors, and lost a few games because of that.
