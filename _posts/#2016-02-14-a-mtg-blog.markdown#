I recently created an account on Magic Online to get my weekly magic fix when I can't attend the local FNM event. The account comes with a bunch of credits that grant you access to new-player drafts, so I joined a _2 x Oath of the Gatewatch - 1 x Battle for Zendikar_ queue. Those are 4 players queues so the strategical depth of the draft is not exactly the best you could get but it's still a good way to learn the format.

In the first pack I open [Munda's Vanguard](javascript:card("Munda's Vanguard")) which was probably the single one card that would have made me happily lock-in the Allies strategy in the first picks.
I see a decent incoming flow of white cards (Isolation Zone, Ondu War Cleric) that make me go heavy on white while staying pretty open on the other colors. I get to pick a Boulder Salvo too but that's the only decent red card that I see. WIih the second pack
